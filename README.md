# PRODIGY_DS_05
Analyze traffic accident data to discover patterns related to time of day, weather, and road conditions. Visualizations include accident frequency by hour and correlation with environmental factors.
# 🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis using Python

This project analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends related to **time of day**, **road conditions**, and **weather**. The goal is to provide insights for safer driving and help identify accident hotspots.

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset Path: `C:\Users\RISHITA\Downloads\archive (1).zip`
- File Format: CSV inside ZIP
- Contains data on various accident-related factors such as location, time, and weather.

## 📊 Key Features
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Visualizations of accident frequency by:
  - Hour of the day
  - Weather conditions
  - Road surface conditions
- Identification of high-risk time slots and conditions

## 📸 Visual Outputs
- `age_distribution.png`: Histogram of driver ages
- `income_vs_spending.png`: Scatter plot showing behavior patterns (if using customer-type dataset)

> 🔁 Note: Visualizations are automatically saved in the `C:\Users\RISHITA\Documents\traffic_dataset` folder after running the script.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required libraries if needed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
3. View output images in your specified folder.
